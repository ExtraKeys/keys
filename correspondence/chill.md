Hey guys, this is definitely a *sensitive subject* for me, you might say (lol,) so - before I reply - I want to **ask for your validation right quick.** 

If you can/are willing/would like to read both my question and the “Framework Engineer”’s answer in their entirety and share your thoughts on whether or not it was answered/anything else…
I’d very much appreciate it.

The answer you got seems like a non-answer. To me it feels like a typical Apple PR comment where what they really mean is *“no comment”* or *“what you’re looking for doesn’t exist”*. I assume the latter is true in this case, which is unfortunate.

thanks for reading it! alright… thanks you to you, I have achieved **Validated Status** and am ready to begin Tearing Framework Engineer an Entirely New Digestive System.

I don’t see what’s wrong with the answer they gave. They said you don’t need unique iPhone considerations, what exactly do you want/expect them to do?


[20-43-2021 11:43 AM] koshakji#0791
If there’s no more documentation than the things they shared, there’s no more documentation. I don’t see what they did wrong


[20-44-2021 11:44 AM] David Blue#1917
it’s not about doing things right or wrong… I was joking about the beef lol. nobody owes *me* anything… I’d just like to figure out how I can get them to see it’d be to *their* advantage to check again.


[20-44-2021 11:44 AM] David Blue#1917
on this, specifically, they need to uh… check again. there are definite differences in support between the two devices.

I would also just like to not have to write all the keyboard shortcuts tables myself, ya know? I’ve been doing it for years but there’s only so much I can do with just blind testing. I keep discovering new shortcuts that would have been really nice to know about uh… 10 years ago.


[20-51-2021 11:51 AM] David Blue#1917
On that note, `Shift + ⌘ + ][` doing some real crazy shit on Safari rn if anyone wants to try it lol


[20-51-2021 01:51 PM] koshakji#0791
I guess you do you, but I feel like you’re overreacting to a support person providing the answer they can provide


[20-33-2021 03:33 PM] David Blue#1917
I don’t want to do anything but bring the issue to light, right? im not trying to *receive* something… I’m trying to encourage this person to wonder why there aren’t any docs… maybe ask their boss.


[20-34-2021 03:34 PM] David Blue#1917
now if the answer to that question is *I don’t care*… **that** would be problematic.

Seems like this conversation is not shortcuts related anyway

I agree, let's keep these channels related to the topic at hand @David Blue

I also do want to emphasize that railing against support people is not the kind of thing I want to do in this community. Griping against people who don't have almost any influence on the system isn't okay, even if its framed as being in jest – I want to foster an environment where feedback from this community is notoriously positive and constructive
