## Complete documentation for native Bluetooth Keyboard support/shortcuts on **iPhone**?

(Before I begin, it might explain quite a bit if I note that the only reason I had not yet posted this question here is that I was not aware I could do so. Otherwise, I would have, years ago.)

Some important acknowledgments:
* *iPhone* (iOS) currently supports Bluetooth Keyboards. In fact, it is being *actively developed on* at this very moment. I know this because I have been documenting (via blind test) Bluetooth Keyboard shortcut alterations in Safari between iOS 15 dev betas.
* When iPad OS was split, so too were both the user-facing and dev-facing official documentation of the operating system’s native support (shortcuts, really,) from Apple. When this happened, the docs all but stopped acknowledging iPhone’s continued support because the goto iPad doc - “[Learn iPad keyboard shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211096)” - does not have an iPhone equivalent. Pretty much all the iPhone User Guide has to offer is [a howto on pairing](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/magic-keyboard-iph2ced3177/14.0/ios/14.0).
* This split - combined with the explicit product introduction of a magic keyboard dedicated to iPad - has resulted in (as far as I can tell, as a non-developer) an overwhelming state of confusion regarding the whole idea of using a Bluetooth Keyboard with iPhone. I have spent the past few years talking to developers who somehow *did not know their iPhone apps had working Bluetooth Keyboard shortcuts*. I have made it a habit to just write the shortcuts tables myself by way of blind testing off the handy iPad guide which appears when ⌘ is held (not on iPhone!)
* There really are those of us who regularly use Bluetooth Keyboards with our iPhones. Most I have met do so for what I would definitively classify as Accessibility concerns. (My personal use is not quite definitively so.)

My question, really is:

**Where can I find complete documentation of both keyboard shortcuts support in native apps/the OS and `UIKeyCommand`’s uniquely-iPhone considerations?**

(Please assume I have seen any related docs on developer.apple.com and support.apple.com.)

I’d like to leave it there at the risk of being uselessly verbose. Thank you for your time. I look forward to hearing back.
