# Chapter 1: Krash Course

To start, I’d like to riff off some of the core considerations you’ll encounter if - somehow - this guide is introducing you to the whole concept of using a Bluetooth keyboard paired with your iPhone and you’re ready to just try it. First, do not bother looking to Apple, itself, for documentation about how to “get started.” I would also advise you generally stick to this guide (unless you’re reading an outdated version in the future) and avoid the intermittent acknowledgements/mostly halfhearted, very fragmented attempts by greater tech media to document specific keyboard shortcuts per individual apps. For gosh sakes, this guide will have completely failed its primary purpose if it is not infinitely more complete, reliable, and considered than anything you’ll find in a Google search.

At this point, we’re also going to assume you’re using one of two very specific products: Apple’s non-iPad or M1 Mac-Specific Magic Keyboard - either in “full” format (with keypad included,) or otherwise. Additionally, we’re going to assume you’re using the current version of iOS running on a non-jailbroken handset with appropriate support. Would you like to know the system information of *my* particular setup? Too bad, here it is:

## Spotlight

Yes, we’re already beginning to talk about actual **Keyboard Shortcuts** from the most essential to least, for the most part, but specifically, I’d like to begin with those that do not behave quite identically to their theoretical touch or on-device hardware input counterparts, the most notable of which is `⌘ + Spacebar`, which calls Spotlight Search on an unlocked iPhone. Ideally, said command places the cursor within Spotlight’s text entry field automatically, but whether or not it successfully does so on the first try is ::subject to a few conditions::. If you find yourself having called Spotlight *without* a blinking cursor in its text entry field, you have two, accessibility-dependent options:

1. You might simply *tap* the text entry field.
2. You can re-cycle the command with `⌘ + H` to return to the homescreen, immediately followed by another `⌘ + Spacebar`.

Whether bug or intended function, this dynamic has existed for the entirety of external keyboard support on iPhone. It’s most troublesome for our primary use of Spotlight, which is not in fact *searching*, but rather a somewhat tedious alternative for *app switching* to iPadOS’ support for the staple `⌘ + TAB` command, which we’ll expand upon ::in an upcoming chapter::.

## Locking/Unlocking & Essential Navigation

If you've previously paired an external keyboard to a booted-up iPhone with its Bluetooth connectivity toggled `ON`, you can unlock said device from a locked state by powering up said keyboard followed by any keypress. Once the devices have connected, the iPhone’s screen should illuminate (this shouldn’t take any more than a few seconds.) TouchID and pre-TouchID devices can be unlocked from here with a single press of the `Spacebar` followed by your chosen PIN, if you’ve set one. FaceID-equipped devices will look for your face as soon as `Spacebar` is pressed. As soon as the PIN is entered correctly or a positive FaceID match is made, the device will open to the view in which it was locked.

To *lock* an iPhone with an external keyboard, use the command `⌘ + ^ + Q`.

To return to the last open homescreen, use `⌘ + H` once. If you’ve configured multiple homescreens and the last open homescreen was *not* the primary/first homescreen, a second press of `⌘ + H` will land you there.

## Text Formatting

The `CAPS LOCK`  toggle key is supported parallel to common desktop implementations for all Apple Bluetooth keyboards and most of those from third parties.
In most native and third-party applications, toggling  `⌘ + B` will format selected text as **bold** or ongoing text entry as **bold**, as `⌘ + I` will toggle *italicized* text.
